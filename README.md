    Aeon | <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a> flake built with <a href="https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib">Snowfall</a> ⚜️ 
</h1>

> [!NOTE]
> This is a WIP rewrite of my [Aeon](https://github.com/mxxntype/Aeon) flake with the [Snowfall](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib) framework. This is absolutely not backwards-compatible and actually a hell of a breaking change. Once the flake is at least somewhat complete and "ready", it will be merged with Aeon.
