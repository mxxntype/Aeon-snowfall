### Styles ðŸŒº

Each "rice" - I hate the word, that's why `styles/`, not `rices/` - I decide to do lives in a directory here in a directory with a codename. All of the configuration that the rice should do lives in modules in that subdir. Those option definitions only apply themselves when the `aeon.style.codename` Home-manager option matches, well, the codename. The stuff that should be common between styles does not live here, it lives in its own modules a few directories up from here. These are for different colors, WM layouts, widget styles, etc.
